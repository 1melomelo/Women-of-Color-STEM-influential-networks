# Women-of-Color-STEM-influential-networks
Welcome to the public GitHub repository for NSF DUE-1937777 grant "Influential Networks for Women of Color in STEM Community College Pathways" 2019-2021.

The primary goal of this repository is primarily educational: to promote computing education for STEM education researchers and actually anyone who wants to learn how to code and analyze data. 

While most of the databases used in this grant are data-restricted, the codes have been created by me (Dr. Melo Yap, and sometimes in collaboration with other data professionals). So while the actual data cannot be loaded in the repository, the codes for data cleaning, analysis (including social network analysis), etc., will be featured here.  

Thanks for checking out this page! 

In Solidarity,
Dr. Melo Yap
